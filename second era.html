      <li><font color="lavender" size="4"><em><big><strong>Akaviri Potentate</strong></big></em>
        <p>While the Akaviri Potentate saw the decline and disintegration of much of the Second Empire, Skyrim was one of the most rebellious provinces in this respect, destroying a fortress at Dawnstar, which catalysed the Potentate to crush all other large-scale armed forces on Tamriel.<br>
          During this period, Skyrim maintained most of its own structure, with the Moot continuing to elect kings and functioning largely independently of Versidue Shae and his son. King Logrolf was the last High King during the Potentate, and was assassinated in 2E 431.</font></p></li>

      <li><font color="lavender" size="4"><em><big><strong>The Interregnum</strong></big></em>
        <p>Following Logrolf's assassination, the Crown chose his daughter, Freydis, as High Queen. This was disputed by Svartr, the Jarl of Solitude, who held a partial moot to proclaim himself High King in the west, signaling the split of Skyrim into two kingdoms.<br> Svartr was unable to keep an influx of orcs fleeing the recent destruction of Orsinium out of his realm, and the chieftain Yashnag Gro-Yazgu, along with increasingly rebellious Reachmen, was a disruptive presence in the West for several decades, although some sources claim this was confined to Falkreath. This was ultimately ended in 2E 467 when Hakkvild slew Yashnag in single combat. Without a leader, the orcs scattered into the Wrothgarian Mountains.</font></p></li>

      <li><font color="lavender" size="4"><em><big><strong>The Second Akaviri Invasion of Tamriel</strong></big></em>
        <p>The Second Akaviri invasion landed east of Windhelm in 2E 572, rather than landing on the east of Morrowind. The leader was the king of the Kamal, Ada'Soom Dir-Kamal. They sacked Windhelm, and killed Queen Mabjaarn and Nurnhilde, her heir. Jorunn, her younger son, either escaped the sack, or was in Riften and came to Windhelm as the gates fell. In response to this invasion, the Ebonheart Pact is formed.<br>
          Jorunn and rallied troops from across eastern Skyrim, including summoning the spirit of Wulfharth to help the Nords. Following the return of Jorunn, now calling himself King Jorunn, the Nords held the Akaviri at bay while the Dunmer approached from the East and cornered the Akaviri at Stonefalls, and, supplemented by a legion of Argonians, drive the Akaviri into the sea.<br>
          Another account claims that Jorunn and Fildgor Strong-Prince arrived at the battle at the same time, and following the invasion dueled for the kingship of Eastern Skyrim to avoid civil war. After three hours of fighting, Jorunn emerged victorious and banished Fildgor, who fled to the Daggerfall Covenant. Ten years after the formation of the Pact, Jorunn is noted to be its head.</font></p></li>

    <br>  <li><font color="lavender" size="4"><em><big><strong>Battle of Sancre Tor</strong></big></em>
        <p>In 2E 852, an allied force of Nords and Bretons occupied the fortress of Sancre Tor in the Jerrail Mountains in northern Cyrodiil, which was then besieged by Talos under the authority of King Cuhlecain, and defeated through Breton treachery.<br><br> Following the battle, the Nords swore allegiance to Tiber Septim, and joined the efforts to conquer Cyrodiil. Note that available texts regarding the battle do not say that this was the point where Skyrim joined the Second Empire, merely that Nordic troops joined the Cyrodiilic army.</font></p></li><br>

      <font color="lavender" size="4"><em><big><strong>Reunification</strong></big></em>
        <p>There is no documented account of how or why Skyrim was reunified, but it had presumably been a single entity for some time when the first Pocket Guide to the Empire was published in 2E 864, as its division and reunification does not merit a mention in the text.<br><br> Either that, or the Imperial Geographic Society had some motive to hide the fact that the kingdom was ever divided. It is also likely that Tiber Septim reunified Skyrim through his actions at Sancre Tor.</font></p></li></ul>
